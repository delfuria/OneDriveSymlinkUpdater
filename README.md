This project does only two things...1 provides a GUI for symlinks and settings, 2 periodically creates/renames an empty file in the root folder of OneDrive. That's it...the empty file just tricks OneDrive to rescan and sync all changes even on symbolic folders. You could have the same result if you created the symlinks by using command prompt and every 10 minutes you created manually a file in OneDrive root folder. This app just puts everything together. :)

OneDriveBUlly was developed to solve exactly that. (thanks toi https://github.com/ktheod)
